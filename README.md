## Unsolved Problems

- Would like to add a list of set meals that User can select and populate their meal input with.  Would be nice to provide a random option too
- Would like to set up a calendar to help the user locate past meals or plan future meals
- Would like to calculate total nutrition consumption in a meal, day, week
- Would like to do more styling to get the website layout to match my wireframes

## Project Planning Process

The planning stage is a step that I want to improve my ability in as I get more experience in developing websites.  I started off writing out my user stories, then put together my wireframes, worked on my backend repo, and then my frontend.  I wanted to make sure I had all my API routes and requests sorted out before changing/adding features and then finally styling.
